# Introduction

- Finance is the lifeblood of the business. The funds invested in the business to carry out its day-to-day activities are called business finance.

# Shares

- The capital of a company is divided into smaller units called shares. Those who subscribe to the shares of a company are known as 'Shareholders'. Two types of shares may be issued by a company to raise capital. They are:-

 1. Equity Shares
 2. Preference Shares

# Equity Shares
