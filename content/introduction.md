An economy is a system that provides people with the means to work and make a living.

### Microeconomics 
- Microeconomics is that part of economics theory that studies the behaviour of individual units of an economy.
### Macroeconomics
- Macroeconomics is that part of the economics theory that studies the behaviour of the aggregate of the economy as a whole.
### Positive Economics 
- Positive economics deals with economic problems and how they are actually solved. It deals with things as they are.
### Normative Economics
- Normative economics deals with what ought to be or how the economic problems should be solved. It tells us what ought to be.

## Economic Problem
#### 1. Scarcity of Resources: 
- Resources are limited in relation to their demand, and the economy can't produce what people want.
#### 2. Unlimited human wants: 
- Human wants are mere ending and differ in priorities; This increases the use of resources that are already scarce.
#### 3. Alternate uses:
- Resources are not only scarce, but they can also be part of various uses. Thus, the economy has to make choices between the alternative uses of the given resources. 

## Central Problems of an Economy:
#### 1. What to produce: 
- This problem involves the selection of goods and services to be produced and the quantity to be produced of each selected commodity It has two aspects:
	1. What possible commodities to produce
	2. How much to produce
#### 2. How to produce:
- This problem refers to the selection of a technique problem to be used for the production of goods and services. These techniques are:
	1. Labour Intensive technique
	2. Capital Intensive technique
#### 3. For whom to produce: 
- This problem relates to the distribution of produced goods and services among the individuals within the economy.

## Production Possibility Frontier/Curve(PPF/PPC): 
- It is the graphical representative of possible combinations of two goods that can be produced with given resources and technology. 

### Assumptions for PPF
1. The amount of resources in an economy is fixed.
2. With the help of the given amount of resources, only two goods can be produced.
3. The resources are fully utilised. 
4. Resources are not equally efficient in the production of all products.
5. The level of technology is assumed to be constant.

### Opportunity Cost
- Opportunity cost is the cost of the next best alternative foregone.

### Marginal Opportunity Cost(MOC)
- MOC refers to the number of units of a commodity sacrificed to gain one additional unit of another.

### Characteristics of PPF:
1. PPF slopes downwards due to inverse relation between change in quantity in 2 commodities.
2. PPF is concave shape due to increasing MRT

### Marginal Rate of Transformation:
- MRT is the ratio of no. of units of a commodity sacrificed to gain an additional unit of another commodity.


MRT = ▵ Units Sacrificed ÷ ▵Units Gained
