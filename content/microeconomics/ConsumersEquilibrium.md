# Consumer

- A consumer is one who buys goods and services for the satisfaction of wants.

## Consumer's Equilibrium with Utility Approach

### Utility

- It refers to the want-satisfying power of a commodity It means realised satisfaction to a consumer when he is willing to spend money on a stock of commodity that has the capacity to satisfy his wants It differs from person to person to person to place and time to time.

### Total Utility

- It is the sum of all the utilities that a consumer derives from the consumption of a certain amount of a commodity.
- TU can be obtained from the sum of marginal utilities from the consumption of different units of a commodity.

### Marginal Utility

- It is additionally made to the total utility as consumption is increased by one more unit of the commodity.

MU = TUn - TUn‚Çã‚ÇÅ

## Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility

- The law of Diminishing Marginal Utility(DMU) states that as we consume more and more units of a commodity, the utility derived from each successive unit goes on decreasing.

## Consumers Equilibrium

- a consumer is said to be in equilibrium when he machines his satisfaction given income and prices of the commodities.

### 1. One Commodity Case

- a consumer purchasing a single commodity will be at equilibrium when he is buying such a quantity of that commodity, which gives him maximum satisfaction.

MUInTermsOfMoney = MuInUtils √∑ MuInOneRupee

### 2. Two Commodity Cases

- A Consumer gets maximum satisfaction when the ratios of MU 2 commodities and their respective prices are equal, and MU falls as consumption increases.

MUùìç√∑Pùìç= MUy√∑Py

## Indifference Curve

- It refers to the graphical representation of various alternative combinations of bundles of 2 goods among which the consumer is different.

### 1. Indifference Map

- It refers to the group of indifference curves that represent consumer preferences over all the bundles of goods.

### 2. Marginal Rate of Substitution(MRS)

- It refers to the rate at which the commodities can be substituted with each other so that the total satisfaction of consumers remains the same.

MRS = ‚ñµG2√∑ ‚ñµG1

#### Properties of indifference curve

1. It is always convex towards the origin due to diminishing MRS.
2. It slopes downwards.
3. A higher indifference curve represents a higher level of satisfaction.
4. They do not intersect each other.

## Budget Line

- It is a line that shows all possible combinations of 2 goods that a consumer can buy with his given income and prices of commodity.
